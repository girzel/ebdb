;;; Commentary:

;; Bits of code for making EBDB nicer to use with China-based
;; contacts, both for handling Chinese characters, and for formatting
;; of phones and addresses.  Be aware that using this library will
;; incur a non-neglible slowdown at load time.  It shouldn't have any
;; real impact on search and completion times.
