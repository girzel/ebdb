;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides functions for reading arbitrary bits of text,
;; interpreting them as records and fields, and then using them to
;; search/display/update/create records.

;; The main entry point is the interactive command `ebdb-snarf'.  It
;; figures out what text we're dealing with, puts the text in a temp
;; buffer, and calls three nested functions: `ebdb-snarf-collect',
;; which finds likely field-related strings in the buffer and groups
;; them, then `ebdb-snarf-collapse', which tries to match that
;; information to existing records, and finally `ebdb-snarf-query',
;; which queries the user about how to handle leftover
;; information. Any resulting records are then displayed.

;; The option `ebdb-snarf-routines' contains regexps that can be used
;; to construct field instances.  `ebdb-snarf-collect' uses the
;; elements of this list to search for relevant strings.

;; Country-specific internationalization libraries are highly
;; encouraged to add values to `ebdb-snarf-routines', locating field
;; information specific to that country/region/language.

;;; Code:

(require 'ebdb-com)

(defcustom ebdb-snarf-routines
  `((ebdb-field-mail "[[:blank:]([<\"]*\\([^[:space:]\":\n<[]+@[^]:[:space:])>\"\n]+\\)")
    (ebdb-field-url ,(concat "\\("
			     (regexp-opt ebdb-url-valid-schemes)
			     "//[^ \n\t]+\\)"))
    (ebdb-field-phone "\\(\\+?[[:digit:]]\\{1,3\\}[ )-.]?[[:digit:] -.()]+\\)"))

  "An alist of EBDB field classes and related regexps.

Each alist element is an EBDB field class symbol, followed by a
list of regular expressions that can be used to produce instances
of that class when passed to `ebdb-parse'.  Each regular
expression should contain at least one parenthetical group: the
`ebdb-parse' method of the class will receive the results of
\(match-string 1\)."

  "A list of regular expressions matching names.

This is a separate option from `ebdb-snarf-routines' because
snarfing doesn't search for names separately, only in conjunction
with other field types.

Regular expressions in this list should not include parenthetical
groups."
