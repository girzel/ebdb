;; EBDB interface to mu4e.  This file was copied from bbdb-mu4e.el,
;; originally written by David Sterratt.

;;; Code:

(require 'ebdb-mua)
(if t (require 'mu4e-view))

(defvar mu4e~view-buffer-name)
(defvar mu4e-view-mode-map)

;; Tackle `mu4e-headers-mode' later

(cl-defmethod ebdb-mua-message-header ((header string)
				       &context (major-mode mu4e-view-mode))
  (set-buffer mu4e~view-buffer-name)
  (message-field-value header))

(cl-defmethod ebdb-make-buffer-name (&context (major-mode mu4e-view-mode))
  "Produce a EBDB buffer name associated with mu4e mode."
  (format "*%s-mu4e*" ebdb-buffer-name))

(defun ebdb-insinuate-mu4e ()
  "Hook EBDB into mu4e."
  ;; Tackle headers later
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map ";" ebdb-mua-keymap))

;; Why wasn't `ebdb-mua-auto-update' ever hooked in to mu4e?

(add-hook 'mu4e-main-mode-hook #'ebdb-insinuate-mu4e)

(provide 'ebdb-mu4e)
;;; ebdb-mu4e.el ends here
