;;; Commentary:

;; This library handles EBDB interaction with various other packages.
;; The name implies integration with mail user agents, but in fact it
;; could be used for any package that wants EBDB pop-up integration.
;; For simplicity's sake, all these packages will be referred to as
;; MUAs.

;; Essentially, this library can make four things happen:

;; 1. Return EBDB records matched by criteria provided by the MUA, and
;; optionally display those records in a pop-up buffer.

;; 2. Handle information provided by the MUA which does not exactly
;; match the existing records.  This can mean creating new records,
;; and/or updating existing records based on new information about
;; names or messages, or running other user-defined rules.  These
;; updates may be automatic or interactive, depending on the user's
;; configuration.

;; 3. Provide hooks for allowing records to be updated automatically
;; by user-specified functions.

;; 4. Provide keybindings for editing or otherwise manipulating the
;; records interactively.
