;;; Commentary:

;; This package began as a port of the Insidious Big Brother Database
;; (by Jamie Zawinski and Roland Winkler) using EIEIO, Emacs' newish
;; object-orientation library.  Eventually it developed to the point
;; where a separate package seemed to make most sense.  But the basic
;; behavior of the package, and the look of the *EBDB* buffer, are
;; still very much indebted to the original library.  Some of the
;; original files have been directly copied over and renamed -- where
;; applicable, the names of the authors of the original libraries have
;; been noted.

;; This file contains the basic data structures and behavior for EBDB,
;; including the class definitions for databases, records, and fields.

FORMAT may be a function that is called with one argument, the address.
See `ebdb-format-address-default' for an example.

%l  locality
