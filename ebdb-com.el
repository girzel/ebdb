Completion happens up to the preceeding colon, comma, or BEG.
Return non-nil if there is a valid completion, else return nil.

Completion behaviour obeys `ebdb-completion-list' (see there).
If what has been typed matches a unique EBDB record, insert an address
formatted by `ebdb-dwim-mail' (see there).  Also, display this record
if `ebdb-completion-display-record' is non-nil,
If what has been typed is a valid completion but does not match
a unique record, display a list of completions.
If the completion is done and `ebdb-complete-mail-allow-cycling' is t
then cycle through the mails for the matching record.  If EBDB
would format a given address different from what we have in the mail buffer,
the first round of cycling reformats the address accordingly, then we cycle
through the mails for the matching record.
With prefix CYCLE-COMPLETION-BUFFER non-nil, display a list of all mails
available for cycling.
