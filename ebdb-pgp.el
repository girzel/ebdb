(defun ebdb-pgp ()
  "Add PGP MML tags to a message according to the recipients' EBDB records.

Use it by adding a \"pgp action\" field to one or more records.

When sending a message to those records (ie, the records appear
in `ebdb-pgp-headers' headers), this grabs the action from their
`ebdb-field-pgp' field.  If multiple records propose different
actions, perform the action which appears first in
`ebdb-pgp-ranked-actions'.  If this proposes no action at all,
use `ebdb-pgp-default-action'.  The variable `ebdb-pgp-method'
defines the method which is actually used for signing and
encrypting.

This command works with both `mail-mode' and `message-mode' to send
signed or encrypted mail.

This file does not automatically set up hooks for signing and
encryption, see Info node `(message)Signing and encryption' for
reasons why.  Instead, you might want to call the command
`ebdb-pgp' manually, then call `mml-preview'.

If you do decide to set up automatic signing/encryption hooks,
use one of the following, as appropriate:

(add-hook 'message-send-hook 'ebdb-pgp)
(add-hook 'mail-send-hook 'ebdb-pgp)"
