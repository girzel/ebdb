;;; Splitting / filing with gnus-folder
;;;
;;; To use this feature, you need to put this file somewhere in your
;;; load-path and add the following lines of code to your .gnus file:
;;;
;;; (setq nnmail-split-methods 'ebdb/gnus-split-method)
;;;
;;; You should also examine the variables defvar'd below and customize
;;; them to your taste.  They're listed roughly in descending likelihood
;;; of your wanting to change them.  Once that is done, you need to add
;;; filing information to your EBDB.  There are two fields of interest:
;;;
;;; 1. gnus-private.  This field contains the name of the group in which
;;;    mail to you from any of the addresses associated with this record
;;;    will be filed.  Also, any self-copies of mail you send any of the
;;;    same addresses will be filed here.
;;; 2. gnus-public.  This field is used to keep mail from mailing lists
;;;    out of the private mailboxes.  It should be added to a record for
;;;    the list submission address, and is formatted as follows:
;;;      "group regexp"
;;;    where group is where mail from the list should be filed, and
;;;    regexp is a regular expression which is checked against the
;;;    envelope sender (from the From_ header) to verify that this is
;;;    the copy which came from the list.  For example, the entry for
;;;    the ding mailing list might be:
;;;      "mail.emacs.ding ding-request@ifi.uio.no"
;;;    Yes, the second part *is* a regexp, so those dots may match
;;;    something other than dots.  Sue me.
;;;
;;; Note that you can also specify a gnus-private field for mailing list
;;; addresses, in which case self-copies of mail you send to the list
;;; will be filed there.  Also, the field names can be changed below if
;;; the defaults are not hip enough for you.  Lastly, if you specify a
;;; gnus-private field for your *own* EBDB record, then all self-copies
;;; of mail you send will be filed to that group.
;;;
;;; This documentation should probably be expanded and moved to a
;;; separate file, but it's late, and *I* know what I'm trying to
;;; say. :)

;;    addresses which have no private group defined in the EBDB.  If the
;;    user's own address has no private group defined, then it will
;;    always be given this priority.
;; 1. This priority is assigned to To/Cc addresses which have a private
;;    group defined in the EBDB.  If crosspost-default is not nil, then
;;    To/Cc addresses which have no private group will also be assigned
;;    this priority.  This is also assigned to the user's own address in
;;    the From position if a private group is defined for it.
;; 2. This priority is assigned to From addresses which have a private
;;    group defined in the EBDB, except for the user's own address as
;;    described under priorities 0 and 1.
;; 3. This priority is assigned to To/Cc addresses which have a public
;;    group defined in the EBDB, and whose associated regular expression
;;    matches the envelope sender (found in the header From_).
;;
;; The split function evaluates the spool priority for each address in
;; the headers of the message, and returns as a list all the groups
;; associated with the addresses which share the highest calculated
;; priority.
